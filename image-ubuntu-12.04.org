* ubuntu 12.04 image
I download this image from the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/colinux/files/Images%202.6.x%20Ubuntu/Ubuntu%2012.04/][colinux project]] , and optimize it.

Default root password: *51colinux*


* image features
image include features: 
 - ext4 format image with size no more than 4G
 - remove desktop
 - upgrade all software to newest(to 2014.1.8)
 - common environment 
 - upstart optimize
 - fix bugs
 - install some common software
 - share directory with host os

more detail information below.

** ext4 format image with size no more than 4G
The image downloaded from colinux large than 4G, so not support for windows FAT32 filesystem.
so I make a image smaller than 4G from the image downloaded.

Changing image format from ext3 to ext4 will be better.

First, create a file no more than 4G.
: fsutil file createnew new.vdi 4000000000

Then, copy *ubuntu-12.04.vdi* to *old.vdi* for the new image.

Modify colinux configure.
: cobd0="images\ubuntu-12.04.vdi"
: cobd1="images\old.vdi"
: cobd2="images\new.vdi"

Now run colinux and format the device in ubuntu.
: mkfs.ext4 /dev/cobd2

Mount both block device.
: mkdir 1
: mkdir 2
: mount /dev/cobd2 2
: mount /dev/cobd1 1

Because cobd2 is smaller than cobd1, wo can not use command dd to copy device. Use cp to copy files.
: cp -a 1/* 2

Last, modify colinux configure and reboot colinux.


** remove desktop
Since we choose windows plus colinux, so no linux desktop have more benefits: 
 1. free space more than 300M
 2. without desktop linux os more stable
 3. easier deployment (no XMing for X window)

I remove packages like Gnome, Kde, Gtk, Qt, Xorg, Xlib and more. handy using these commands:
: root@51colinux:~# dpkg -l|grep gnome
: root@51colinux:~# apt-get purge *gnome*


** upgrade all software to newest
: root@51colinux:~# apt-get update
: root@51colinux:~# apt-get upgrade


** common environment 
There is a number of problems of the origin ubuntu image.

First, the keyboard layout is de, i reset it: 
: root@51colinux:~# dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration

Second, support chinese utf-8: 
: root@51colinux:~# locale-gen --purge zh_CN.UTF-8 en_US.UTF-8

Last, choose *en_US.UTF-8* as default language:
: root@51colinux:~# cat /etc/default/locale
: LANG="en_US.UTF-8"
: LANGUAGE="en_US:en"

Use shanghai as default time zone:
: cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Shanghai /etc/localtime


** upstart optimize
Set runlevel4, it is quicker than runlevle2 in ubuntu 12.04 because only tty1 in runlevel4. By modify file */etc/inittab* .


** fix bugs
bugs include:
 - File */dev/ptmx* disappear when reboot guest os
 - Can not mount cofs through */etc/fstab*

Fix script is written in file */etc/rc.local* . 


** install some common software
 - emacs23-nox, vim
 - apt-file
 - gcc, g++, make, subverion, git 
 - nmap
 - unrar, unzip (windows's common compress format )


** share directory with host os
The share directory is *share* In the host os. In the guest, the share directory is */root/windows* which is a soft link tothe file */mnt/win* .


* change file list
 - /etc/hostname
 - /etc/hosts
 - /etc/network/interfaces
 - /etc/rc.local
 - /etc/inittab
 - /etc/default/locale
 - /etc/issue
 - /etc/fstab
